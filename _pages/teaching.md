**IOE 265 - Probability and Statistics for Engineers**

* Graphical Representation of Data; Axioms of Probability; Conditioning, Bayes Theorem; Discrete Distributions (Geometric, Binomial, Poisson); Continuous Distributions (Normal Exponential, Weibull); Covariance and Correlation; Point and Interval Estimation, Likelihood Functions, Test of Hypotheses for Means, Variances and Proportions for One and Two Populations.

**IOE 545 - Stochastic Networks and Operations**

* Introduction to queueing networks and their use in modeling and analysis of operational systems. Methodological topics include regenerative processes, Markov processes, embedding, reversibility, quasi-reversibility, approximations for open and closed networks, intro to control of Markov queueing systems. Application of these stochastic models and the “physics” of flow operations with emphasis on services, healthcare, and production.

> Arizona State University

**IEE 376 - Operations Research Deterministic Techniques/Applications**

* Introductory course on deterministic mathematical models and developing solution methods for real–life optimal decision problems. The theoretical foundation will emphasis the simplex algorithm, theorems of duality, sensitivity analysis, network flows, and basic integer programming. Applications in a variety of domains, including transportation, health care, finance, and manufacturing.
