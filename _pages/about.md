Hello! I am a Ph.D. student in the [Industrial and Operations Engineering][1] department at the [University of Michigan][2]. As part of a joint degree program, I am also a Master's student in the [Department of Statistics][3] at the University of Michigan. I did my undergraduate studies at [Arizona State University][4].

I have the pleasure of being advised by Professor [Mark P. Van Oyen][5]. I am also fortunate to have my Ph.D. supported by a graduate research fellowship from the [National Science Foundation][6].

My research is at the intersection of [optimization and machine learning][7]. In particular, I am drawn to the design of algorithms for decision-making  in real-time operations. Many problems I have worked on have involved limited, reusable resources and are motivated by applications in [healthcare][7] and [revenue management][7]. My goal is to leverage theory and problem domain knowledge to provide efficient solutions in complex environments.
