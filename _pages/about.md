Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Oxford][2] working with [Agni Orfanoudaki][3]  at the [Sa√Ød Business School][1]. Before my postdoc, I obtained my Ph.D. from  the [Industrial and Operations Engineering][4] department at the [University of Michigan][5], where I had the pleasure of being advised by [Mark P. Van Oyen][6] and the privilege of being  supported by a  [National Science Foundation][7] Graduate Research Fellowship.


My research is at the intersection of [optimization and machine learning][8]. In particular, I am drawn to the design of algorithms for real-time operations and the study of how people engage with algorithmic tools in practice. The majority of my work is motivated by applications in [healthcare][8] and [revenue management][8]. Many of the problems I focus on have involved limited, reusable resources and heterogeneous patient/customer types.  

I am on the academic job market for the year 2024-2025.
