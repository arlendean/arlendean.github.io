Hello! I am a Ph.D. student in the Industrial and Operations Engineering department at the University of Michigan. As part of a joint degree program, I am also a Master's student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan. I did my undergraduate studies at Arizona State University.

I have the pleasure of being advised by Professor Mark P. Van Oyen. I am also forturante to have my Ph.D. supported by a graduate fellowship from the National Science Foundation.

My research is at the intersection of optimization and machine learning. In particular, I am drawn to the design of algorithms for decision-making  in real-time operations. Many problems I have worked on have involved limited, reusable resources and are motivated by applications in healthcare and revenue management. My goal is to leverage theory and problem domain knowledge to build efficient solutions. As part of this, I seek to also study the interplay between algorithms and people.
