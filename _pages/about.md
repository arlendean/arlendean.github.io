Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Industrial and Operations Engineering][1] department at the [University of Michigan][2]. As part of a joint degree program, I am also a M.A. student in the [Department of Statistics][3] at the University of Michigan. I did my undergraduate studies at [Arizona State University][4].

I have the pleasure of being advised by Professor [Mark P. Van Oyen][5]. I am also fortunate to have my Ph.D. supported by a graduate research fellowship from the [National Science Foundation][6].

My research is at the intersection of [optimization and machine learning][7]. In particular, I am drawn to the design of algorithms for real-time operations and the study of how people engage with algorithmic tools in practice. The majority of my work is motivated by applications in [healthcare][7] and [revenue management][7]. Many of the problems I focus on have involved limited, reusable resources and heterogeneous patient/customer types.
