**Abstract:**
We study the problem of deciding patient to hospital care unit placements in real-time. We develop a dynamic resource allocation algorithm to decide unit placements by learning the care needs of different patient types. We model hospital beds as reusable resources and assume decision feedback is not immediately available but rather delayed for an unknown, random length of time. Lastly, for robustness, we also consider the demand unknown and allow patient arrivals to be arbitrarily sequenced. The applicability of our algorithm is demonstrated with real-patient data from a hospital collaborator, where we evaluate our proposed approach using unplanned readmission rates as the performance metric.
